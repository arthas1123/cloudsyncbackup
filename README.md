# CloudSyncBackup

A lightweight, modular backup tool that allows CLI-triggered file backup, event logging, and planned cloud sync.

## ðŸ§© Features
- Modular C++ architecture with EventBus for event-driven design
- CLI interface to trigger backups
- Background thread execution for non-blocking operations
- Event-based logger for clean separation of concerns
- Future support for event history storage and cloud upload

## ðŸš€ Current Progress (as of 2025-05)
- [x] EventBus: publish/subscribe model
- [x] Logger: listens and records events
- [x] BackupWorker: reacts to BackupRequestedEvent using background thread
- [x] CLI command `--backup` triggers event
- [x] Modular structure for testing and reuse
- [ ] ðŸ”œ Event recorder module: save structured events as JSON
- [ ] ðŸ”œ ThreadPool for concurrency control (planned)
- [ ] ðŸ”œ Cloud upload support (Cloudflare R2 / Google Drive)

## ðŸ›  Usage
```bash
# Compile (example with clang++)
clang++ -std=c++17 -g src/main.cpp -o cloudsync \
  src/cli_parser.cpp src/logger.cpp src/backup.cpp \
  src/threading/backup_worker.cpp -Iinclude

# Run backup
./cloudsync --backup
